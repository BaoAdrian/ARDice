# ARDice
Basic iOS application developed using the ARKit framework to perform various augmented reality 
processes to a dice asset such as 3D location and plane detection as well as 3D randomized animations.
Application allows the user to detect a horizontal plane within the virtual reality and select a 
location where they wish to roll a dice. Randomized roll animation is triggered upon successful 
detection of selected horizontal plane.


Developed using Swift 4 within Xcode 9.4.1. Completed as part of an assignment for a course utilizing basic
tools within the ARKit framework and introductory concepts of AR environment manipulation and animation.
